		  <li> World Blood Donor Day is celebrated every year on June 14 to promote awareness regarding need for safe blood. The need for blood is universal,
				but access to blood for all those who need it is not. World Blood Donor Day is celebrated every year on June 14 to promote awareness regarding need for safe blood.</li>
          <li> Human Blood: red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma and platelets are made naturally by the body in the bone marrow. </li>
   		  <li> There is no substitute for human Blood. </li>
  		  <li> Blood makes up about 7% of your body's weight. </li>
  		  <li> An average adult has about 14 to 18 pints of Blood. </li>
          <li> One standard unit or pint of Blood equals about two cups. </li>
          <li> Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to all of the body. </li>
          <li> Blood carries carbon dioxide and other waste products back to the lungs, kidneys and liver for disposal. </li>
          <li> Blood fights against infection and helps heal wounds. </li>
          <li> One unit of donated whole Blood is separated into components before use (red Blood cells, white Blood cells, plasma, platelets, etc.) </li>
          <li> There are four main Blood types: A, B, AB and O. </li>
          <li> Each Blood type is either Rh positive or negative. </li>
          <li> There are about one billion red Blood cells in a few drops of whole Blood. </li>
          <li> Red Blood cells live about 120 days in our bodies. </li>
          <li> Red Blood cells can be stored under normal conditions for up to 42 days. </li>
          <li> Frozen red Blood cells can be stored for ten years, and more. </li>
          <li> Platelets must be used within five days. </li>
          <li> Platelets are small Blood cells that assist in the process of Blood clotting helping those with leukemia and other cancers, controlling bleeding. </li>
          <li> Plasma, the fourth major component of Blood, is a sticky, pale yellow fluid mixture of water, protein and salts. It is 95% water. The other 5% is made up of nutrients, proteins and hormones. </li>
          <li> Blood Plasma constitutes 55% of the volume of human Blood. </li>
          <li> Plasma helps maintain Blood pressure, carries Blood cells, nutrients, enzymes and hormones, and supplies critical proteins for Blood clotting and immunity. </li>
          <li> Type AB plasma has been considered as the universal Blood plasma type, and therefore AB plasma is given to patients with any Blood type. </li>
          <li> Frozen Plasma can be stored for up to one year. </li>
