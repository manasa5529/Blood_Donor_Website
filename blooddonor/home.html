		<p class="b">The first blood transfusion 
		dates back to 16th century where a british physician RICHARD LOWER kept a dog alive in 1665 when he accidentally bled it to almost death and then revived 
		the animal by tranfusing blood from another dog via a tied artery. The first human blood transfusion was done by JAMES BLUNDELL in 1818 to treat
		postpartum hemorrhage and was successfully executed in 1840 to treat hemophilia. In 1932 the first blood bank was established and they became famous in 1941 when CHARLES
		RICHARD DREW's research in the field of blood transfusions, improved techniques for blood
		transfusion.</p>

		<p style="width:880px;" class="b">A blood donation occurs when a person
		voluntarily has blood drawn and used for transfusions and/or made into biopharmaceutical medications by a process called fractionation. 
		Donation may be of whole blood, or of specific components directly. Blood banks often participate in the collection process as well as the procedures that follow it.

		<h1 style="width:650px;" class="a">WHY DONATE BLOOD ?</h1>
		<p style="width:730px;" class="b">There is a constant need for a regular supply of blood 
		because it can be stored only for a limited period of time before use. Regular blood donation by a sufficient number of healthy people is needed to ensure that blood will always be available whenever 
		and wherever it is needed. Blood is the most precious gift that anyone can give to another person â€“ the gift of life. A decision to donate your blood can save a life, or even several if your blood is 
		separated into its components.<strong>"ONE DONATION COULS SAVE THREE LIVES."</strong></p>
